# Tutorial: Getting started with multi-module workspaces

All code from this folder belongs to this tutorial only: https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/workspaces

Note: the article uses module prefix `example.com`, but I will change it to `tuta.deputy`

The `example` folder is cloned from google: `git clone https://go.googlesource.com/example` (after that, I removed the `.git` folder inside it)
